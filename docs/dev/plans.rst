# Plans

* Make an option to provide a default head so that
  one can just configure their emission strategy
  and use
* Make a mechanism to remove the head or tail of a
  chain, and other clever manipulation tools
* Catch internal errors that are being generated by
  the validation code, and reraise them
* Make a schema mechanism for pytrees, and pytree
  validation a thing.
